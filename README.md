# spotline

Got inspired by: [L3v3L/vs-focus](https://github.com/L3v3L/vs-focus).

## Features

`spotline.apply` ( <kbd>ctrl+f8</kbd> )

+ Blurs unselected lines.
+ Run again or use `spotline.reset` ( <kbd>ctrl+shift+f8</kbd> ) to clear blur.
+ Above is applied to all opened editors.

## Configurtion

In `settings.json` :

+ Opacity of unselected lines can be modified with `spotline.opacity` .
+ If `spotline.asTypeWriter` is `true`, keep first selection in the center of window.

## Planned feature

+ Specifying whether to apply individually for each editor.



**Enjoy!**
