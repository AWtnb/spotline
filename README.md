# spotline

got inspired by: [L3v3L/vs-focus](https://github.com/L3v3L/vs-focus).

## Features

+ `spotline.apply` ( <kbd>ctrl+f8</kbd> ) blurs unselected lines.
    + if this command is executed while other lines are already blurred, the blur will be cleared.
+ `spotline.reset` ( <kbd>ctrl+shift+f8</kbd> ) clears all blur.

## Currently known issues

+ Switching tabs resets the blur. In order to reapply, `spotline.apply` must be run again.



**Enjoy!**
